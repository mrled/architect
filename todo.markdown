# Bugs and to do list

- We call the Docker volume the "jenkins data volume" in variable names, but it's mounted at /var/lib/docker, so we should change the name
- Upgrade to Ansible 2.6
- Add Mitogen support
- See TODO entries in comments
- Update readme to indicate this is no longer just Architect, it's all my infrastructure (except Algo)
- Rename the repo
- Do something different with the architect-jenkins docker image
- Rename variables: use a role prefix, make everything pretty uniform
